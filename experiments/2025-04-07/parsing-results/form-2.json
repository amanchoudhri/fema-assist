The floodwaters caused substantial damage to the rail lines, track bed, signals, and train control systems,\npreventing all rail freight and passenger service between Anchorage and Fairbanks for several days. A robust clean up and\nemergency repair effort, conducted between May 13 and May 25, required substantial mobilization costs due to the remote area and\nextensive repairs. On May 14, the ice jam broke and water levels receded sufficiently to allow inspection of the tracks by ARRC.",

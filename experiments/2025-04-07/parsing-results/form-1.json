    "damage_description": "On December 4, 2017 a fast moving storm system moving northward out of the Gulf of Alaska brought widespread high winds to coastal areas on both the east and west sides of the Kenai Peninsula. These high winds, gusting 30-40 mph, produced 3-4 foot waves that lasted for 4-8 hours in Seward, coinciding almost perfectly with the highest astronomical tide of the year, causing significant wave action damage to occur. Resurrection Bay in Seward experienced a 13.4 foot-high tide in conjunction with high southerly winds on December 4. This combination of events caused serious erosion to the Lowell Point Road that connects South Seward with the community of Lowell Point and the Lowell Point State Recreation Area (SRA).\n\nIn the Lower Cook Inlet area, this storm system created high winds gusting 30-40 mph, reaching a maximum wind speed of 58 mph, producing 7-10 foot waves that impacted the Cook Inlet coastline from Homer to Kenai. Two SRAs, the Anchor River SRA and the Deep Creek SRA, each sustained extensive damages to campgrounds, parking areas, boat launches, and beach areas.",

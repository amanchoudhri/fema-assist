The earthquake produced strong seismic shaking that caused widespread and severe damage to homes, major highways, roads, bridges, transportation infrastructure, road embankments, railroad tracks, critical utility infrastructure, public and commercial buildings, including structural collapse and resulting fires.

The PDA was hampered by limited daylight hours (approximately six hours), recent snowfall accumulations of up to four feet total, very cold single-digit ambient temperatures, and extremely hazardous driving conditions. Also, several homes with reported minor damage were upgraded to major damage after interior inspections reveal failures of load-bearing walls, compromised roof beams, uneven floors, missing or collapsed walls, or other signs of catastrophic structural damage. The PDA team could not visit the Kenai Peninsula Borough due to hazardous road conditions. It is clear there are a potentially substantial number of damaged homes and businesses that were not visited by the PDA teams."

Over 50,000 customers lost power during the storms, and restoration efforts continued until May 8, 2018. Damages validated during joint Preliminary Damage Assessments exceeded the statewide threshold, even when only counting damages within counties which exceeded thresholds.",

Emergency Relief and Assistance Fund (ERAF) is provided from the State general fund to assist municipalities with a percentage of non-federal cost share (ranging from 30% to 70% of non-federal share, depending on communities' status with respect to five criteria articulated in Vermont's ERAF Rule). Communities are responsible to raise their portions of non-federal share through local property taxes. Vermont's Town Highway Emergency Relief Fund provides some funding to communities in non-qualifying counties.

Agriculture is the main industry in Nebraska, and as a result of the storms statewide many of the crops have\nbeen damaged or destroyed; the true value of the impact on agriculture won't be known until harvest is completed.

The floodwaters caused substantial damage to the rail lines, track bed, signals, and train control systems, preventing all rail freight and passenger service between Anchorage and Fairbanks for several days. A robust clean up and emergency repair effort, conducted between May 13 and May 25, required substantial mobilization costs due to the remote area and extensive repairs.

Resurrection Bay in Seward experienced a 13.4 foot-high tide in conjunction with high southerly winds on December 4. This combination of events caused serious erosion to the Lowell Point Road that connects South Seward with the community of Lowell Point and the Lowell Point State Recreation Area (SRA).\n\nIn the Lower Cook Inlet area, this storm system created high winds gusting 30-40 mph, reaching a maximum wind speed of 58 mph, producing 7-10 foot waves that impacted the Cook Inlet coastline from Homer to Kenai. Two SRAs, the Anchor River SRA and the Deep Creek SRA, each sustained extensive damages to campgrounds, parking areas, boat launches, and beach areas.",
